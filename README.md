# IoT-Based Heart Rate Monitoring System
IoT-based heart rate monitoring system for real-time health tracking.

## Overview
This project is an **IoT-based Heart Rate Monitoring System** that uses an **Arduino Uno** and a **heartbeat sensor** based on the **Photoplethysmography principle**. It detects changes in blood volume to measure heart rate in real time, making it useful for **health tracking, fitness monitoring, and biofeedback applications**.

## Features
- Real-time heart rate monitoring
- Uses an Arduino Uno and a heartbeat sensor
- Based on the **Photoplethysmography** principle
- Converts analog sensor data into readable heart rate values
- Can be integrated into healthcare and wellness applications

## Components Used
- **Arduino Uno**
- **Heartbeat Sensor (Photoplethysmography-based)**
- **LCD Display (Optional, for real-time output)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Power Supply**

## Working Principle
The heartbeat sensor detects changes in blood volume by assessing variations in light intensity. The **Arduino Uno** processes the analog
signals from the sensor and converts them into heart rate readings, which can be displayed on an **LCD screen** or sent to an IoT
platform for further analysis.

## Installation & Setup
1. **Connect the Components**
   - Interface the heartbeat sensor with Arduino following the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload the Code**
   - Use the Arduino IDE to upload the heart rate monitoring code to the Arduino board.
3. **Monitor Output**
   - View the real-time heart rate on the serial monitor or LCD display.
4. **(Optional) IoT Integration**
   - Send data to an IoT platform for remote monitoring.

## Applications
- Personal health tracking
- Fitness monitoring for athletes
- Remote patient monitoring in healthcare
- Biofeedback and stress analysis
